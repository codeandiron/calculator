Hi there!

Thanks for taking the time to review my work.




BUILDING WITH APACHE MAVEN==============================
1. Navigate to the root level of the project (with the pom.xml)
2. type: "mvn clean package" and press Enter, ensure all test cases pass and "BUILD SUCCESS" appears

BUILDING WITHOUT APACHE MAVEN===========================
1. Navigate to the root level of the project (with the pom.xml)
2. type: "javac src/main/java/com/kontagent/*" and press Enter
3. Confirm there are now several class files at src/main/java/com/kontagent

RUNNING THE APPLICATION=================================
1. Set your CLASSPATH
2. Set your JAVA_HOME
3. Ensure that you have permission to execute kontagent_ss (sudo chmod u+x kontagent_ss)
4. Execute the shell script by typing "./kontagent_ss /home/coolcoder/workspace/freshmeat/kontagent/crazymatrix.csv" and pressing enter.

ASSUMPTIONS/NOTES=======================================
-The application doesn't fail very gracefully, nor does it recover very well. If it detects malformed input it will reject it outright.
-Normally I would not do things like System.out.println, System.exit(0), or read file input from an absolute path. I promise I would never do anything like that in production potential code.
-Normally I would not "roll my own" CSV parser, Math library, Matrix manipulator, etc., but I'm assuming the use of third party libraries is discouraged for this exercise.

Thanks again,
Have a great day,
Matt Holtom
