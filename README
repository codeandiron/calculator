This is a Reverse Polish Notation calculator that uses a matrix (excel style) spreadsheetas input.

BUILDING WITH APACHE MAVEN=======================================
1. Navigate to the root level of the project (with the pom.xml)
2. Set your CLASSPATH to the maven target directory: "export CLASSPATH=/home/coder/workspace/calculator/target/classes"
3. Set your JAVA_HOME: "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_03"
4. Build the project: "mvn clean package", ensure all test cases pass and "BUILD SUCCESS" appears

BUILDING WITHOUT APACHE MAVEN====================================
1. Navigate to the root level of the project (with the pom.xml)
2. Set your CLASSPATH to the src directory: "export CLASSPATH=/home/coder/workspace/rpn-calc/src/main/java/com/calculator"
3. Set your JAVA_HOME: "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_03"
4. Compile the files: "$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac src/main/java/com/calculator/*"
5. Confirm there are now several class files at src/main/java/com/calculator

RUNNING THE APPLICATION==========================================
3. Ensure that your user has permission to execute calculator ("sudo chmod u+x calculator")
4. Execute the application by typing "./calculator /home/coder/workspace/calculator/src/main/resources/crazy.csv" and pressing enter.
5. You may redirect the stdout to a file by appending "&> output.csv" to the command
6. There are already several CSV's available at src/main/resources/*.csv

ASSUMPTIONS/NOTES===============================================
-Although it says it's not a requirement, the application does handle multi-cell indirection. It'll even do okay if you have a cell that's an operation on a cell reference that points to another cell that has an operation.
-It will not do multiple cell references in one cell (So no =B2 A2 *) 
-The application doesn't fail very gracefully, nor does it recover very well. If it detects malformed input it will reject it outright.
-Normally I would not do things like System.out.println, System.exit(0), or read file input from an absolute path. I promise I would never do anything like that in production potential code. I also do absolutely zero logging in this application, on purpose.
-Normally I would not "roll my own" CSV parser, Math library, Matrix manipulator, etc., but I'm assuming the use of third party libraries is discouraged for this exercise.
