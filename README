This is a Reverse Polish Notation calculator that uses a matrix of CSV cells as input. It can be thought of as similar to excel, where cells can reference other cells in their "Formulas". In Reverse Polish Notation, the operator comes before the operands in the formula (e.g. =* 5 4, or =+ A3 8).

SETUP============================================================
1. Set your JAVA_HOME (absolutely): "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_03"
2. Navigate to the root level of the project (with the pom.xml)


BUILDING WITH APACHE MAVEN=======================================
1. Build the project: "mvn clean package", ensure all test cases pass and "BUILD SUCCESS" appears
2. Set your CLASSPATH (absolutely) to the maven target directory: "export CLASSPATH=/home/coder/workspace/calculator/target/classes"


BUILDING WITHOUT APACHE MAVEN====================================
1. Compile the files with javac: "$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac src/main/java/com/calculator/*"
2. Confirm there are now several class files at src/main/java/com/calculator
3. Set your CLASSPATH (absolutely) to the src directory: "export CLASSPATH=/home/coder/workspace/rpn-calc/src/main/java/com/calculator"


RUNNING THE APPLICATION==========================================
1. Ensure that your user has permission to execute calculator shell script ("sudo chmod u+x calculator")
2. Execute the application by typing "./calculator /home/coder/workspace/calculator/src/main/resources/crazy.csv" and pressing enter.
3. You may redirect the stdout to a file by appending "&> output.csv" to the command
4. There are already several CSV's available at src/main/resources/*.csv

ASSUMPTIONS/NOTES===============================================
-The calculator does handle multi-cell indirection. It'll even do okay if you have a cell that's an operation on a cell reference that points to another cell that has an operation.
-It will not do multiple cell references in one cell (So no =B2 A2 *). This is a potential future improvement.
-Normally I would not do things like System.out.println, System.exit(0), or read file input from an absolute path. I promise I would never do anything like that in production potential code. I also do absolutely zero logging in this application, on purpose. This calculator was originally built as an exercise for a company I interviewed at.
-Normally I would not "roll my own" CSV parser, Math library, Matrix manipulator, etc., but I assumed the use of third party libraries was discouraged for this exercise.
